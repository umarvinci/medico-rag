# Medical Evidence Workspace

Accuracy-first educational medical RAG. **Unsupported answers are unacceptable; abstention is a
successful outcome.** M1 implements authorized PDF upload, publication/version metadata and durable
ingestion tracking; M2 adds Docling parsing, structured normalization with page and coordinate
provenance, and parse-quality validation; M3 adds structure-aware hierarchical chunking with
complete span-level provenance, deterministic chunk identity and chunk-quality validation; M4 adds
pinned MedCPT dense embeddings, a versioned Qdrant index and verified index activation; M5 adds the
pinned MedCPT Query Encoder, a versioned PostgreSQL BM25 lane, reciprocal rank fusion and a measured
retrieval baseline; M6 adds pinned MedCPT CrossEncoder reranking, deterministic context expansion
and a bounded, provenance-preserving EvidenceSet; M7 adds the Evidence Sufficiency Gate and
provider-independent grounded drafting, where generation is attempted only when the gate returns
SUFFICIENT and a draft is explicitly unverified; M8 adds claim-level verification, where a draft
becomes an answer only if every material claim survives citation, provenance, numeric, negation and
support checks, with at most one repair; M9 adds the Ask experience, where a verified answer is
delivered with its citations and every other outcome is an explained refusal; M10 adds authorized,
versioned tenant configuration with explicit runtime/rebuild lifecycles and immutable safety rules;
M11 adds a layered evaluation framework that measures each stage separately and attributes every
failure to the stage that caused it.
Successful jobs stop at **RETRIEVAL_READY**, which means both retrieval lanes verified over the same
chunk dataset — **not** that the document is answerable. Retrieval returns ranked evidence candidates
with their provenance, and the EvidenceSet is source material for inspection, not a judgment that the
evidence suffices. Only the verified Ask contract can deliver answers; diagnostic endpoints remain
non-answering.

The stack is FastAPI/Pydantic/SQLAlchemy, React/TypeScript/Vite/TanStack Query, PostgreSQL,
Redis/Celery, MinIO/S3, Docling and Qdrant, with OpenAI and Anthropic reached only through isolated
adapters.

## Start locally

Requires Python 3.12/3.13, uv, Node >=22.12 and Docker Compose v2 with a running Linux engine.
From the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/init_local_env.py
python scripts/init_dev_auth.py
uv sync --frozen
docker compose up -d --wait postgres qdrant redis minio
docker compose run --rm minio-init
uv run --env-file .env alembic upgrade head
docker compose --profile app up -d --build --wait
```

Open http://localhost:5173/library. Read your generated **local development access keys** from
ignored `.local/dev-access.txt`; enter the admin key in the Library access form. The reader key
demonstrates read-only access. Scripts preserve existing credentials. Never commit or print keys.
The browser retains its key in tab memory only; reauthenticate after reload.

Select a synthetic PDF, supply a title, source type and authority, then upload. Library and document
details show the actual version, checksum, ingestion history and, once the worker has parsed it, the
real parser build, policy version, page/element/table/figure/formula counts, OCR usage and
validation outcome. "Open parse inspector" shows the parsed pages, structured elements with their
page coordinates, extracted tables, figure crops, formulas and validation findings. Operations shows
jobs, errors and retry/reparse/cancel controls. Assessment material cannot claim reference/high
authority. Upload metadata defaults to UNREVIEWED.

The parsing worker downloads model weights on its first document into the `parser-models` volume,
so the first parse after a fresh volume takes noticeably longer and needs outbound network access.

For host development, run the API and Vite instead of their containers. Keep infrastructure and
the worker/dispatcher running; see [deployment](docs/architecture/deployment.md).

## Upload API

Authenticated endpoints use `/api/v1`. Upload with `POST /documents` or
`POST /documents/{id}/versions`: the body is raw PDF bytes, Content-Type is `application/pdf`,
`Idempotency-Key` is a UUID, and `X-Upload-Metadata` is base64-encoded UTF-8 JSON (12,000-character
encoded limit). New-publication metadata has this shape:

```json
{
  "filename": "source.pdf",
  "edition": "First",
  "publication_year": 2025,
  "document": {
    "title": "Synthetic reference",
    "source_type": "TEXTBOOK",
    "authority_level": "UNREVIEWED"
  }
}
```

For a new version, omit `document`; publication metadata is edited separately. Uploads are limited
to 128 MiB by default. Identical bytes within the same tenant return a deterministic duplicate
response. A network retry with identical metadata/content and request key returns the same IDs.
A confirmed failed attempt can use a new key; the UI handles this response. Sources are downloaded
through authorized API requests, never public bucket URLs.

Parsed material is inspected through `GET /documents/{id}/versions/{vid}/parse` and
`/parse-runs/...` (runs, pages, page previews, elements, tables, figures, formulas, findings and the
raw parser artifact). Every route enforces the same tenant boundary as the original, and object
storage is never exposed.

Chunked material is inspected through `GET /documents/{id}/versions/{vid}/chunk-runs` and
`/chunk-runs/...` and `/chunks/...` (runs, chunks with type/page/relationship filters, chunk detail,
ordered source mappings, question objects and validation findings). No route returns a storage key,
a lease token or any vector field.

Embedding and index state is inspected through `GET /documents/{id}/versions/{vid}/embedding`,
`/embedding-runs/...` and `/index-runs/...` (runs, vector metadata, index runs, live index
statistics and validation findings). No route returns a dense vector, and the browser never talks
to Qdrant.

Retrieval is inspected through `POST /retrieval/search` (developer/operator permission),
`GET /retrieval/status` and the sparse-index and query-encoder-version routes. A search response
carries ranked candidates, lane diagnostics and a reproducible trace, and states
`answering_enabled: false`; it has no answer, confidence or vector field.

## Verify

With development infrastructure running:

```powershell
$env:MEDRAG_RUN_INTEGRATION = '1'
uv run --env-file .env pytest -q
uv run ruff check backend workers scripts
uv run ruff format --check backend workers scripts
uv run mypy backend/app
uv run python scripts/check_skills.py
uv run --env-file .env alembic check
docker compose config --quiet
npm --prefix frontend ci
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run build
$env:MEDRAG_E2E_LIVE = '1'
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL = 'chrome'
uv run --env-file .env npm.cmd --prefix frontend run test:e2e
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/smoke_m1.py
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/smoke_m2.py
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/smoke_m3.py
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/smoke_m4.py
uv run --extra parsing python scripts/evaluate_parsing.py
uv run python scripts/evaluate_chunking.py
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/evaluate_embeddings.py
```

Embedding needs its model provisioned once, which is the only step that reaches the network:

```powershell
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/provision_embedding_model.py
```

The containerised worker reads the same pinned revision from the `embedding-models` volume and runs
with downloads disabled. See [embeddings](docs/architecture/embeddings.md) for the provisioning
workflow.

Browser tests use installed Chrome and Vite port 4173, while the container UI remains on 5173.
Alternatively install Playwright Chromium and omit the channel override. Live browser tests require
the migrated API, worker and dispatcher. They create synthetic documents in the development tenant.
Backend integration tests use a temporary PostgreSQL schema and their own UUID object keys; schema
upgrade/downgrade and failure cleanup do not erase application data. Without the integration flag,
live tests skip; a unit-only result does not verify persistence or queues.

original bootstrap request are preserved.

This is a local development implementation: development bearer identities are not production OIDC,
basic PDF checks are not antivirus, parse-, chunk- and index-quality thresholds are uncalibrated
defaults chosen against synthetic fixtures, retrieval quality has not been measured at all, and
there is no clinical validation or compliance certification.


## Configuration administration (M10)

Open `/settings` with an admin account. The ten sections project approved typed settings from the
backend registry. Preview and confirm runtime policy changes; subsequent tenant requests use one
immutable revision. Chunk/analyzer proposals stay pending until the established external rebuild
and activation workflow is completed; this UI does not restart services or rebuild indexes.

Shared runtime settings and safety requirements are read-only. API keys are managed externally;
only credential presence is shown. `MEDRAG_APPROVED_MODELS` provides an operator-owned JSON list
of approved provider/model pairs; configured generator/verifier pairs are included automatically.
Migration `m10_configuration` is required before starting the updated API.

See [configuration management](docs/architecture/configuration-management.md),
[ADR-015](docs/adr/015-m10-controlled-configuration.md) and [verification](docs/verification/m10.md).


## Evaluation (M11)

```bash
uv run python scripts/evaluate_m11.py                                     # offline, no API key
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/evaluate_m11.py --include-models  # + model-backed layers
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/evaluate_m11.py --live            # + opt-in provider calls
```

Eleven layers are measured and reported separately. There is deliberately no single accuracy
score, because parsing fidelity, Recall@5 and a false-PASS count are not commensurable and
averaging them would hide the one quantity that matters. A failure is attributed to the earliest
stage that declared it, so a retrieval miss is never reported as an over-eager gate.

Offline is the default and is what CI runs: no API key, no provider call, no PostgreSQL, no
Qdrant — and every hard safety invariant is measured in that mode. `--live` is never implied by
another flag and costs money. Artifacts land in `docs/evals/m11/`.

Every dataset carries an explicit independence class next to its numbers, because a fixture
written alongside the code it scores proves something quite different from a case the policy never
saw. **Nothing here is expert-reviewed, and M11 engineering evaluation is not clinical validation.**

See [evaluation architecture](docs/architecture/evaluation.md),
[ADR-016](docs/adr/016-m11-layered-evaluation.md) and [the report](docs/verification/m11.md).


## Production hardening (M12)

Production is a configuration this system **refuses to run badly**. With
`MEDRAG_ENVIRONMENT=production` the process will not start unless OIDC identity is configured,
development principals are absent, rate limiting is on, CORS origins are explicit HTTPS entries,
credentials are present and not development defaults, backing services are not on localhost, and
the encoder models are offline-pinned. The error names every unmet rule and prints no secret.

```bash
uv run python scripts/production_preflight.py     # read-only; no provider call unless asked
uv run python scripts/smoke_m12.py                # headers, RBAC, isolation, secrets, bounds
uv run python scripts/load_test.py --reads 200    # deterministic providers by default
uv run python scripts/verify_restore.py --database "$RESTORE_URL"
```

Identity is vendor-neutral OIDC: issuer, audience and claim names are configuration, and nothing in
the code knows which provider is in use. Signature verification cannot be disabled, algorithms come
from configuration rather than the token header, and only asymmetric algorithms are supported so
this service never holds a key that could mint tokens.

The safety pipeline is unchanged. M12 added barriers around it and removed none: there is no fast
path, no verification-disabled mode and no provider-direct answering, and a test asserts the
codebase contains no such switch.

**No claim of HIPAA compliance, certification, clinical validation or absence of hallucination is
made.** The controls are designed to support future compliance work; they do not constitute it, and
every quality limitation recorded in M11 still stands.
