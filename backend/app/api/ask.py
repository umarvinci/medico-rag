"""The public Ask API.

`POST /api/v1/ask` is the first endpoint in this system that may return a medical answer, and it
returns one only when M8 verified every material claim. The M5–M8 diagnostic endpoints are
unchanged: they still pin `answering_enabled` false and still return exactly what they always did.
Nothing was retrofitted into an answering endpoint.

Citation and source inspection deliberately adds no new document routes. The M2 parse API already
streams page previews, elements, tables, figures and formulas under `document:read` with tenant
scope resolved server-side, so a citation links into those rather than handing the browser an
object-store URL of its own.
