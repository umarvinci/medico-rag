"""M9 Ask orchestration: one authorized path from a question to a shown answer, or to a refusal.

This service adds no decision of its own. It calls the existing M5→M8 pipeline, reads the outcome
those stages already reached, records the turn, and shapes a public response. Every rule about
whether a question *can* be answered lives upstream; duplicating any of it would create a second
place for the answer rule to drift, and the second place is the one that gets it wrong.

The only thing this file decides is what a reader is shown — and there the rule is single-valued:
an answer is released when, and only when, M8 returned PASS.
