"""M8 orchestration: verify the M7 draft, repair at most once, then release or abstain.

The whole point of this service is that a draft arrives untrusted and only one path exists out of
that state. `verified=True` is constructed in exactly one place — behind a PASS — and every other
path returns a typed abstention.
