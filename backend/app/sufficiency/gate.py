"""The Evidence Sufficiency Gate.

Runs before generation and decides whether generation may be attempted at all. The decision is made
from structural properties of the EvidenceSet — how many independent sources support the question,
whether the artifact the question depends on is actually present and complete, whether anything was
dropped for budget, whether the sources disagree — and never from a retrieval, fusion or reranker
score. See ADR-012 for why a single number cannot stand in for any of this.
