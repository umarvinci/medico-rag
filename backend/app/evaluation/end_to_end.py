"""The held-out end-to-end layer: gate, generation contract, verification, Ask outcome.

Every decision here is made by the production objects — `SufficiencyGate`, `extract`,
`verify_claims`, `find_contradictions`, `decide` — over EvidenceSets built by the same helper the
M7 evaluation uses. What is substituted is the *provider*, and only the provider: the generator's
output is prescribed by the dataset rather than sampled from a model, and the verifier is a
deterministic double. That keeps the default evaluation free of paid API calls while leaving the
logic under test untouched, and it is why a failure here is a failure of this repository's code
rather than of a model's mood on the day.

The final mapping from pipeline state to Ask outcome is deliberately a copy of
`AskService._outcome`, and `test_m11_units.py` asserts the two agree on every reachable state. A
divergence between what the evaluation calls a refusal and what the product calls a refusal would
make every end-to-end number here quietly wrong.
