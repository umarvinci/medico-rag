"""Which stage caused a failure, and what the declared reason codes mean.

Every code here already exists somewhere in the pipeline: the sufficiency gate, the verifier, the
evidence assembler, the retrieval services, the generation adapters or the M6 evaluation helpers.
Nothing in this module invents a new name for a condition the system already declares, because a
second name for one condition is how a taxonomy starts disagreeing with the code it describes.

The one rule that matters here is **upstream attribution**. A question that fails because the
first stage never retrieved the evidence will also, later, look like an insufficiency: the gate
correctly refuses because there is nothing to answer from. Attributing that to the gate would
credit the gate with a failure retrieval caused, and would make an end-to-end report say the
system abstains too often when what it actually does is retrieve too little. `attribute` therefore
returns the *earliest* layer that declared a code, never the last one to notice.
