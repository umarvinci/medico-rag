"""M9 conversation history.

The first milestone since M1 that genuinely needs new durable state: a conversation the user can
come back to must outlive the request that produced it. What is stored is deliberately narrow — the
question, the outcome, the answer *only when it was verified*, and the identity of the sources that
supported it. Prompts, provider responses, drafts that failed verification, verifier reasoning and
request-scoped EvidenceSets are not persisted; none of them is something a user needs to re-read and
every one of them is something a store should not accumulate.

Every table carries `tenant_id` and is reachable only through a composite key that includes it, so
ownership is a property of the row rather than of the query that happened to find it.
