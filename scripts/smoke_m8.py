"""Containerized upload-to-verified-answer smoke.

Drives a real upload to RETRIEVAL_READY and then through the M8 endpoint. Whatever the outcome, the
property this smoke exists for is that `verified` is true only when a verified answer is present and
every material claim in it was checked — and that no path returns an unverified answer.
